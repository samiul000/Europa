            <h2>Europa</h2>
            <p>Europa or Jupiter II, is the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter, 
                and the sixth-closest to the planet of all the 95 known moons of Jupiter. 
                It is also the sixth-largest moon in the Solar System. 
            </p>
            <p>Europa is made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an ironâ€“nickel core. 
                It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen.
            </p>
            <p>Europa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System.
                The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface is due to a water ocean beneath the surface, 
                which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life, 
                although it would most likely be that of single celled organisms and bacteria-like creatures.
            </p>
            <P>
                Wondering!!! How a organism can survive under a thick layer of ice crust without any sun-light.
                Dive in to know about the secrets of their survival technique....
